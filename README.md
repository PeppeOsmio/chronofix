# Chronofix

## Introduction

Chronofix is a Go project that can change the modified time of files and/or their EXIF DateTimeOriginal (the time when a picture, a video, etc... were taken) based on the name of the files.

## Get started

Create a config file named `config.yml` in the root of this project and copy the content of `config_example.yml` into it. Edit the config file as you like.
